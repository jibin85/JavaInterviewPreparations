J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) patterns, also known as J2EE design patterns, are design patterns 
specifically tailored for enterprise-level applications using the J2EE platform. These patterns are focused on solving 
common architectural problems in enterprise Java applications and ensuring best practices for building scalable, 
reliable, and maintainable applications.

Here’s an overview of some of the key J2EE design patterns:

 1. Business Tier Patterns:

	1. Business Delegate Pattern: 
		Provides a layer of abstraction between the presentation layer and business logic. It helps in minimizing the 
		coupling between these layers and encapsulates the complexity of accessing business services.
		  - Example: A `BusinessDelegate` class that handles all business logic calls and encapsulates the details of 
		             remote service lookups and interactions.

	2. Session Facade Pattern: 
		Provides a simplified interface to a set of business methods, hiding the complexities of the underlying business
		logic. It’s often used to reduce the number of business method calls made from the presentation layer.
		  - Example: A `SessionFacade` class that aggregates multiple business operations into a single method call.

	3. Service Locator Pattern: 
		Encapsulates the logic required to locate and access various services (e.g., EJBs, JMS) in a single class. It 
		abstracts the lookup mechanism and centralizes service access.
		  - Example: A `ServiceLocator` class that retrieves and manages service instances.

 2. Presentation Tier Patterns:

	1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern: 
		Separates the presentation logic, user interface, and application logic. The Model represents the data, the View
		displays the data, and the Controller handles user input and updates the Model.
		  - Example: In a web application, JSP pages act as the View, Servlets or controllers manage the input and 
		             logic, and JavaBeans represent the Model.

	2. Front Controller Pattern: 
		A design pattern used to provide a centralized request handling mechanism. It handles all incoming requests and 
		delegates them to appropriate handlers or views.
		  - Example: A single `FrontController` servlet that processes all requests and forwards them to appropriate 
		             views or controllers.

	3. Composite View Pattern: 
		Combines multiple components or fragments into a single view, which can then be rendered as a complete page.  It
		helps in reusing view components and managing complex views.
		  - Example: Using JSP includes and tag libraries to assemble complex web pages.

 3. Integration Tier Patterns:

	1. Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern: 
		Separates data access logic from the business logic, providing a consistent interface for accessing and 
		manipulating data from various sources (e.g., databases, XML files).
		  - Example: A `UserDAO` class that provides methods to access and manipulate user data in a database.

	2. Transfer Object (TO) Pattern: 
		Used to transfer data between layers or processes, often in the form of a data structure or object. It reduces 
		the number of method calls and improves performance.
		  - Example: A `UserTO` class that encapsulates user data and is passed between the business layer and the 
		             presentation layer.

 4. Enterprise Tier Patterns:

	1. Value Object Pattern: 
		Represents an immutable object that encapsulates a set of values. It is used to pass data between layers or 
		processes in a consistent and efficient manner.
		  - Example: A `Currency` class that represents a monetary value and provides methods for handling currency 
		             operations.

	2. Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern: 
		Separates the data access logic from the business logic, providing a consistent interface for accessing data 
		from different sources (e.g., relational databases, XML).
		  - Example: A `UserDAO` class that provides methods to perform CRUD operations on user data.

 5. Additional Patterns and Practices:

	1. Interception Pattern: 
		Provides a mechanism to intercept and modify requests or responses. It’s often used for cross-cutting concerns 
		like logging or security.
		  - Example: Interceptors in a web application that handle logging, security checks, or transaction management.

	2. Business Process Management (BPM) Patterns: 
		Patterns related to defining and managing complex business processes or workflows within enterprise applications.
		  - Example: Using BPM tools or workflows to model and automate business processes.

J2EE patterns help address common challenges in enterprise application development, such as separation of concerns,  
scalability, maintainability, and reusability. They are essential for designing robust and efficient enterprise-level 
applications using the Java platform.
