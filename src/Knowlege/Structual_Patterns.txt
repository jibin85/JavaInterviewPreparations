Structural design patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient. These patterns help define how objects and classes should be composed to form larger structures and ensure that the components fit together seamlessly.

Here are the main structural design patterns:

 1. Adapter Pattern

- Purpose: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface the client expects. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
- Usage: Useful when you need to integrate with third-party libraries or legacy code that does not conform to the current systemâ€™s interface.
- Example: Adapting an old logging system to a new logging framework.

 2. Bridge Pattern

- Purpose: Separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It involves an abstraction that delegates the work to an implementation object.
- Usage: Useful when you need to change the implementation of an abstraction without affecting the clients that use it.
- Example: A remote control interface that can operate different types of devices (TVs, radios) through a common abstraction.

 3. Composite Pattern

- Purpose: Allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- Usage: Useful when you need to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, such as in graphical user interfaces or file systems.
- Example: A graphical drawing application where shapes like circles and rectangles are treated as components that can be grouped into a composite shape.

 4. Decorator Pattern

- Purpose: Adds new functionalities to an object dynamically without altering its structure. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- Usage: Useful when you need to add responsibilities to objects at runtime and want to avoid creating a large number of subclasses.
- Example: Adding scroll bars, borders, or additional features to a graphical component.

 5. Facade Pattern

- Purpose: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with it. It hides the complexities of the subsystem and provides a higher-level interface.
- Usage: Useful when you want to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying client interaction.
- Example: A `HomeTheaterFacade` that provides a single interface to control a TV, DVD player, and sound system.

 6. Flyweight Pattern

- Purpose: Reduces the number of objects created by sharing common data among similar objects, thereby improving performance and reducing memory usage. It uses a shared object (flyweight) to represent many similar objects.
- Usage: Useful when you have a large number of objects with shared data and want to minimize memory usage.
- Example: A text editor that uses flyweights to manage and render characters, where each unique character is shared among many instances.

 7. Proxy Pattern

- Purpose: Provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to another object. It can be used for various purposes such as access control, lazy initialization, or logging.
- Usage: Useful when you need to control access to an object or provide additional functionality such as caching, security checks, or logging.
- Example: A `Proxy` class that controls access to a `RealSubject` by performing security checks or lazy loading.

 Summary

- Adapter Pattern: Converts an interface into another interface that clients expect, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together.
- Bridge Pattern: Separates abstraction from implementation, allowing both to vary independently.
- Composite Pattern: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, treating individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- Decorator Pattern: Adds new responsibilities to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
- Facade Pattern: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding its complexities.
- Flyweight Pattern: Reduces the number of objects created by sharing common data among similar objects.
- Proxy Pattern: Controls access to another object, providing additional functionality like caching or security.

These structural patterns help manage the relationships between objects and classes, making the system more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain.
